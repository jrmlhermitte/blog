    "- used one of the [protobuf wrapper types](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto). This would wrap primitive types into a message. Since a Message does encode presence, this solve the problem. However, the lookup of a value would involve first checking presence, and then accessing the `value` attribute of the message (since the primitive was actually defined there)\n",
