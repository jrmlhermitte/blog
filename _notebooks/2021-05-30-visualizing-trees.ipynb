    "When looking at the data, we will segment it by some sort of boundary for easier visualization.\n",
    "We could use tiling approaches, but it will be fun to use existing data. \n",
    "Let's try the zip code \n",

    "\n",
    "## Bigquery: The pandas API\n",
    "These datasets are actually pretty small to download and work with offline.\n",
    "But since this data is offered publicly in bigquery, and bigquery offers up to \n",
    "2TB of queries free per month (here we'll be running about 12 GB of queries),\n",
    "it is well worth leveraging. On top of this, some of the queries we need to make\n",
    "will involve geospatial joins. It will be much easier to let bigquery handle this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The queries that will be presented could just be run in the UI [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery). However, for convenience,\n",
    "they will be run in a jupyter notebook."

    "Also, for visualization, I demonstrated choropleth plots.\n",
    "It's also possible to visualize using tiling schemes. A very common\n",

    "See [here](https://plotly.com/python/hexbin-mapbox/) for more details.\n",
